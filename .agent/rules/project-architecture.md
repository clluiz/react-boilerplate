# High Level Architecture and Folder Organization

This project follows a **Feature-Based Module** architecture. Each major domain of the application is encapsulated within its own "Feature" folder, promoting scalability and maintainability.

## Core Directories

### 1. `src/routes` (Tanstack Router)

- **Purpose:** Contains the routing definitions for the application using [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest).
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Defines the URL structure and hierarchy.
  - Loads data required for routes (loaders).
  - Imports and renders page components from `src/features`.
- **Constraint:** These files should be thin wrappers. avoid complex UI logic here; delegate that to the `features` layer.
- **Note:** `routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by Tanstack Router and should not be manually passed.

### 2. `src/features` (Domain Modules)

- **Purpose:** Contains the business logic and UI for specific domains of the application (e.g., `auth`, `profile`, `dashboard`).
- **Structure:** Each feature folder (e.g., `src/features/foo`) should contain:
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components specific to this feature.
  - `pages/`: Top-level "Page" components that are exported and used by `src/routes`.
  - `hooks/`: Feature-specific React hooks.
  - `utils/`: Helper functions specific to this feature.
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions for this feature.
  - `api/`: API integration and data fetching logic tailored to this feature.

### 3. `src/common` (Shared Resources)

- **Purpose:** Contains resources that are **shared across multiple features**.
- **Constraint:** Do not put feature-specific code here. If code is only used by one feature, it belongs in that feature's directory.
- **Content:**
  - `components/`: Generic UI components (buttons, inputs, layout wrappers).
  - `hooks/`: Global hooks (e.g., `useTheme`, `useWindowSize`).
  - `utils/`: General utility functions (date formatting, string manipulation).
  - `types/`: Global type definitions.

### 4. `src/assets`

- **Purpose:** Static assets such as images, fonts, and global CSS files.

## entry Points

- `src/main.tsx`: The application entry point where the React root is mounted.
- `src/App.tsx`: Sets up the global providers (e.g. RouterProvider, QueryClientProvider).
